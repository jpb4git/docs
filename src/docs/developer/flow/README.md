# Building Flows with Automate Studio

With Veritone Automate Studio, less-technical users can create their own AI Solutions that incorporate Veritone's cognitive engines and real time services directly into custom business applications.

## What is Veritone Automate Studio?

Automate Studio has three components:

1. The Automate Studio design environment, where users can drag and drop activity nodes &mdash; representing discrete units of business logic &mdash; onto a Flow Designer canvas, and test the logic using the Flow Designer runtime.
2. The Veritone Engine framework, which serves as the production-grade runtime for Flow instances, which run "as an engine." (In Veritone parlance, this is just a fancy way of saying "custom logic that runs on Veritone's aiWARE platform.")
3. An Admin component, accessible via the Veritone Developer admin UI.

## Why do you need Automate Studio?

Automate Studio lets you quickly develop enterprise-grade AI solutions that tap into veritone's 300+ Cognitive engines across more than a dozen classes of AI cognition.

## What can you do with Automate Studio?

What you build is entirely up to you! Want to send out e-mail alerts when a Face is recognized? You can use Automate Studio to do that! Want to scrape the web for training data? You can automate it! You could even build a flow that texts your designated recipients and asks them to confirm if certain detections are accurate, and then setup logic to handle the recipient's response!

## How does it work?

Veritone Automate Studio is built with the [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) open source technology that is supported by the JS Foundation. At Veritone, we have taken this foundational open source technology and infused our own aiWARE palette of nodes that abstract away the underlying Veritone logic and data model, making it easier for users to take advantage of the underlying power of aiWARE.

For more info on how Automate Studio fits into the aiWARE architecture, see [our FAQ](developer/flow/faq).
